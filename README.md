# Bag2Coin

> It's a good thing that we're using bags that can be recycled. However, even with these bags, we still need bags for shopping sometimes. The problem is that a lot of these reusable bags end up piling up at home.

> Unlike plastic bags, which we don't think twice about using as garbage bags, reusable bags often have nice designs and seem fancy. So, we feel bad about throwing them away. This can lead to our homes becoming messy, and this happens to many households. So, while using reusable bags is a good idea, it can also create new problems at home.

> The accumulation of recyclable bags at home could have more value when gathered in larger quantities. What if we create a machine that trades recyclable bags for coins? This could make them more beneficial for community groups, schools, retailers, supermarkets, and others.

> Whether or not this is economically feasible remains uncertain. However, the primary goal isn't financial gain; it's about preserving the Earth and living together responsibly, which holds more significance than monetary considerations.

## Open-Source Collaboration:

We welcome open-source developers to join us in enhancing the Outdoor Bag2Coin Recycler (Bulk Storage & Vacuum Compaction Version). Your contributions can drive innovation, improve accessibility, and positively impact the environment.

### Why Collaborate:

**Innovate**: Contribute your skills to make the recycling machine more efficient and eco-friendly.

**Accessibility**: Help keep recycling technology affordable and accessible worldwide.

**Community Impact**: Promote responsible waste disposal and encourage paper bag reuse.

### How to Get Involved:

Contribute by submitting pull requests (to further detail the designs) or suggesting features.

## Key Features and Components:

### Bulk Bag Collection System:

Utilizes a designated bulk bag collection container with a larger capacity to store numerous bags.
Equipped with a secure locking mechanism to prevent unauthorized access.
Incorporates a user identification system (RFID cards or PIN codes) for authorized personnel to access the bulk bag collection container.
Logs and tracks each access and retrieval for monitoring and accountability.
Optionally, offers scheduled pickups or retrievals for official users, with notifications to alert them when bags are ready for collection.

### Bag Compaction System:

Utilizes vacuum-sealed bags specifically designed for the recycling machine.
One-way valves in the bags allow air to be removed while preventing re-entry.
The machine seals vacuum-sealed bags and activates a vacuum pump to remove air, compacting the bags within.
Compacted bags take up significantly less space than uncompressed bags.

### Coin Disbursement Mechanism:

Coin hopper stores various coin denominations.
Precision coin sorter accurately counts and sorts coins.
Releases the appropriate amount of coins based on the bag's condition and user preferences.

### User Interface:

User-friendly touchscreen display for easy interaction.
Supports various payment methods, including cash, credit/debit cards, and mobile payments.

### Safety and Security Features:

Emergency stop button for user safety.
Safety sensors to detect anomalies or hazards.
Security measures to prevent tampering or unauthorized access.
Water-Resistant Enclosure:

Designed with a water-resistant enclosure, allowing the machine to be hosted in open spaces without damage from rain or other environmental factors.

### Solar Panels:

Equipped with solar panels to harness energy from the sun for operation, making the machine more sustainable and reducing its reliance on grid electricity.

### Backend Control System:

Operated by a microcontroller or PLC to manage all machine functions.
Maintains a secure database to record transaction data, machine status, and user accounts (if applicable).

## Operational Process:

1. Users place their paper bags into the designated slot or tray and initiate recycling via the touchscreen interface or payment system.

2. The machine inspects bags, removes loose dirt or debris, and calculates the equivalent coin value based on bag condition and user input.

3. Coins are dispensed accordingly.

4. The machine places the cleaned bags into vacuum-sealed bags and activates the vacuum pump to compact them.

5. Compacted bags are stored in the bulk bag collection container for authorized users.

6. Authorized users can access the container using their identification method and retrieve the compacted bags at their convenience.

7. All transaction details are recorded in the machine's database for auditing purposes.

## Considerations:

- The water-resistant design allows for outdoor placement, making it suitable for public spaces.
- Solar panels contribute to sustainability and reduce operating costs.
- Continued focus on safety, security, and environmental responsibility is maintained throughout the system.
